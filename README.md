# Wrath of Cthulhu

## Idea
Our current game idea is within the genre of 2D, side scrolling, co-op, brawler with elements of a roguelike game. 

## Game Overview
A 2D, side scrolling shooter that has roguelike elements. You will take the role of a character from the 1920s in a world where Ancient creatures have begun to spawn, and it’s your job to figure out how to end it. You will go through many levels, defeating enemies and acquiring gold, with the help of character upgrades and unique items which all serve different purposes. The world depends on your skill and craftiness.

You, as the player, will take control over one of two (hopefully four) playable characters. Each character will have a weapon specific to them and a unique starting item. You will progress through the levels while obtaining new items and character upgrades along the way.

## Why create this game?

We are creating this game because we are fans of unique items and character upgrades which tends to be used within many 2D games. We also felt that the world of H.P. Lovecraft is not used very often in today’s game market which is a huge shame because there is so much to explore in this world that is almost made for video games.

## Theme
This game will take place in a populated city, London, that has been invaded by the ancient creatures. The setting is in the 1920s and the theme is gothic so the houses are going to have spires and the general tone of the game will be extremely dark and sinister.
